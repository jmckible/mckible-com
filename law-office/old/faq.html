  <p><strong>Do I have a good case?</strong><br />
    There are three things that make up a good case:
  </p>
  <ol>
  <li>The fault must be on the other party.</li>
  <li>The claimed injuries must be related to the accident.</li>
  <li>As a practical matter, you or the party at fault has to be insured or the party at fault has to have personal assets.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>How much is my case worth?</strong><br />
In general, you have a right to make a claim for your medical bills, pain and suffering, lost wages, any permanent injury, as well as other damages. A lawyer experienced in personal injury claims will be able to give you a range of the settlement and/or trial value of your claim.</p>

<p> The value of a case is determined in one of two ways. Either the claim is settled through negotiation with the insurance company or a jury determines the value after a trial.</p>

<p><strong>How long will it take to settle my case?</strong><br />
It is appropriate to begin settlement negotiations with the insurance company after you have been released from your doctor. At that point, you will either be 100% recovered from your injuries, or you may be left with a permanent injury. This process can range from weeks to months and depends upon many factors, not the least of which is the reasonableness of the parties.</p>

<p>Generally in New Hampshire, a claim must be settled, or a lawsuit commenced within three years from the date of an accident. If this does not occur, you will be forever barred from pursuing your claim by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need to hire a lawyer?</strong><br />
That depends on whether you feel you are capable of handling your own case. New Hampshire&#39s state motto is &quot;live free or die.&quot; You can build your own house, trade your own stocks, or fix your own car. If you are happy with the settlement offered to you by the insurance company it doesn&#39t really matter what a lawyer believes the value of your claim is. Just keep in mind that the insurance adjuster has years of experience handling claims and obviously has the insurance company&#39s best interests in mind, not yours. If you want to level the playing field, then your decision should be to speak with an experienced personal injury lawyer.</p>

<p><strong>How are lawyers paid?</strong><br />
Lawyers are paid either hourly, or by a contingent fee. A contingent fee is a fee based upon a percentage of recovery. Most clients choose a contingency fee agreement, because they won&#39t have to pay their lawyer until their claim is settled.</p>

<p><strong>What is your &quot;track record&quot;?</strong><br />
McKible Law Office does not claim &quot;millions of dollars collected for our clients&quot; because we believe that this is a foolish statement as any reasonably good injury lawyer who has been in practice for a number of years has probably collected &quot;millions of dollars&quot; for his/her clients.</p>

<p>McKible Law Office has handled a variety of injury claims, including automobile accidents, motorcycle accidents and dog attacks. These claims have ranged from those with modest injuries to those with very serious injures, as well as death claims.  McKible Law Office has successfully settled thousands of injury claims over the past 25+ years.</p>

<p>Many of our current clients were referred to us by friends or family members who were prior clients of ours.</p>

<p>Once a claim is settled we ask our clients to complete a &quot;Law Office Report Card&quot;.  This evaluation form allows our client to comment on the level of service provided.  Was our service professional and courteous?  Did we answer phone calls in a prompt manner?  Was Attorney McKible easily accessible?  Were you satisfied with the outcome of your case?  Would you recommend us to a friend or family member?  Thousands of these report cards have been returned to us with very favorable comments.</p></div></td></tr>
