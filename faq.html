<p><strong>Do I have a good case?</strong><br />
There are three things that make up a good case:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The fault must be on the other party.</li>
  <li>The claimed injuries must be related to the accident.</li>
  <li>As a practical matter, you or the party at fault has to be insured or the party at fault has to have personal assets.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>How much is my case worth?</strong><br />
  In general, you have a right to make a claim for your medical bills, pain and suffering, lost wages, any permanent injury, as well as other damages. A lawyer experienced in personal injury claims will be able to give you a range of the settlement and/or trial value of your claim.</p>
     <p> The value of a case is determined in one of two ways. Either the claim is settled through negotiation with the insurance company or a jury determines the value after a trial.</p>

 <p><strong>How long will it take to settle my case?</strong><br />
   It is appropriate to begin settlement negotiations with the insurance company after you have been released from your doctor. At that point, you will either be 100% recovered from your injuries, or you may be left with a permanent injury. This process can range from weeks to months and depends upon many factors, not the least of which is the reasonableness of the parties.</p>
          <p> Generally in New Hampshire, a claim must be settled, or a lawsuit commenced within three years from the date of an accident. If this does not occur, you will be forever barred from pursuing your claim by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need to hire a lawyer?</strong><br />
     That depends on whether you feel you are capable of handling your own case. New Hampshire's state motto is "live free or die." You can build your own house, trade your own stocks, or fix your own car. If you feel that you can get a fair settlement dealing with an insurance adjuster (who usually has years of experience handling claims), keep in mind that Abraham Lincoln said... "He who represents himself has a fool for a client."</p>

<p><strong>How are lawyers paid?</strong><br />
     Lawyers are paid either hourly, or by a contingent fee. A contingent fee is a fee based upon a percentage of recovery. Most clients choose a contingency fee agreement, because they won't have to pay their lawyer until their claim is settled.</p>
